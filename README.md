  **[Solution](CalculateWeightOnDifferentPlanets.kt)**

**2. Senselessness S Count**
    Count the number of times the letter ‘s’ appears in the word senselessness.
    Describe the rules for the count function by providing an anonymous function as an argument. 
    
  **[Solution](SenselessnessSCount.kt)**
  
**3. Anonymous Greeting Function**
    Define an anonymous function within the main function, call it, and print the result. The anonymous function 
    should define a variable and return a greeting message string. 
    
  **[Solution](AnonymousGreetingFunction.kt)**
  
**4. Assign Anonymous Greeting to a Variable**
    First complete the challenge above(AnonymousGreetingFunction). 
    Then using Function Type, assign the anonymous greeting function to a variable.
    
  **[Solution](AssignAnonymousGreetingFunctionToVariable.kt)**
  
**5. Add guest to Anonymous Greeting Function**
    First complete the two challenges above (AnonymousGreetingFunction and AssignAnonymousGreetingFunctionToVariable). 
    Then add a guest2 who will be greeted with the original guest.
    
  **[Solution](AddGuestToAnonymousGreetingFunction.kt)**
  
**6Volume of a Box**
    Create an object with width, height and length values and create a function that gets the object arguments 
    and prints the volume of the box. 
    
  **[Solution](VolumeOfBox.kt)**
  
  
**7. Use Lambda to Square Number**
    Create a lambda that produces the square of a number.    
    
  **[Solution](LambdaToSquareNumber.kt)**
  
**8. Calculate a Grade using a Lambda**
    Calculate a grade using a lambda.
  
  **[Solution](LambdaGradeCalc.kt)**
  
**9. Missing Angle**
    Create a function that classifies the missing angle as either “acute”, “right” or “obtuse” based on its degrees. 
    Provide two numbers as arguments and calculate the missing degree by adding the two numbers and subtracting 
    that from 180.  
    
  **[Solution](MissingAngle.kt)**
  
**10.Number Limit**
    Write a function which takes three number arguments (one number as an input and the other two numbers 
    representing the lowest and highest points of the range). If the number falls within the range, print 
    the number. If the number is less than the lower limit of the range, print the lowest limit number and 
    if the number is greater than the upper limit of the range, print the highest number.
